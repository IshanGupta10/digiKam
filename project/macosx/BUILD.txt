How To build digiKam.app for MacOS-X from source in 3 easy steps (based on DarkTable Mac application builder) :

1) Install XCode DeveloperPackage from Apple
   Install macports from macports.org make shure you have the latest version ( sudo port -v selfupdate )

   !!! default install is /opt/local/ change this below if you have different macport dir !!!


2) Recompile digiKam under Macports. Look README.MACOSX for details.

3) To make a disk image, run ./project/macosx/make-app-bundle -- this will create digiKam.dmg in the release directory, which contains a standalone application.
