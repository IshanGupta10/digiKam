To download all needed git repositories, execute the
    ./download-repos
script.

If you are a developer with push access to the repositories, it is strongly recommended
to use the "kde:" prefix and let git use the read-only mirrors for pulling.
If you did not clone this repository (digikam-software-compilation) from kde:, do it again:
    git config --global url.git://anongit.kde.org/.insteadof kde:
    git config --global url.ssh://git@git.kde.org/.pushinsteadof kde:
    git clone kde:digikam-software-compilation
